## Hello, I'm Ria. Thanks for dropping by!

I'm a Creative Writing major turned Technical Writer who enjoys learning new tools and technologies.  

I've been working full-time as a technical writer in the last decade, but I have more than 20 years of professional writing and editing experience under my belt. I'm a content expert specializing in technical documentation and technical marketing.

Before I focused on technical writing, I was a traveler writer, a tech magazine contributor, and a public relations writer. 

I'm currently on a career break, but l'm open to working on interesting projects where I can continue honing my skills and challenging myself. Let's connect.
